FlatFinder is a revolutionary dApp where autonomous AI agents operate on blockchain to transform
affordable housing. These intelligent agents handle everything from listing curation to rental
management, all secured on-chain. Hold $FLAT tokens to activate personalized housing agents that
find ideal affordable listings ($500-$2,500/month), execute smart contracts for all transactions, and
earn rewards for positive participation. Built on Virtuals Protocol, this AI agent ecosystem aligns
incentives between all stakeholders while giving $FLAT holders governance rights over the agents'
parameters and platform development, turning housing from a monthly expense into community-
governed digital infrastructure.
